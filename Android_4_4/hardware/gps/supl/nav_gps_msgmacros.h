/*! \name GPS Subframe Bits Extract Macros

	These macros extract bits from an array and converts
	the result into a U4 or I4. The GPS subframe word has
	the following format.

	\verbatim
	MSB                                               LSB
	+------------+----------------------+---------------+
	| 2 Pad Bits |   24   Data   Bits   | 6 Parity Bits |
	+------------+----------------------+---------------+
	\endverbatim

	The offset is the offset into the subframe including
	the parity bits. The number of bits to extract is the
	number of databits excluding the parity.

//! Unsigned Bits Extract from a GPS Subframe format
/**
	
	The macro performs the following steps:
	- get the first word and shift the bits to the MSBs
	- check if we have to add another word
	- if so load it and attach it to the other bits
	- shift back the bits to the LSBs
	
	\note The bits that are to be extract must not span more than two data words.

	\param pkAdr IN a pointer to the array.
	\param ofs   IN the bit offset in the array.
	\param num   IN the number of bits to extract.
	\return the composed word.
