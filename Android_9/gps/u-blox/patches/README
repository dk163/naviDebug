patches for original AOSP
=========================

suggested installation procedure:
- repo start <branch_name> <project>
- cd <project>
- git apply < path/to/patchfile
- git add <modified and new files>
- git commit -a -m "<commit message>"


1) SV mask handling
-----------------------

provided patch file: 4.0.x/v40x_almephmask.patch 
                     4.3.1_r1/v431r1_almephmask.patch
                     4.4.2_r2/v442r2_almephmask.patch
 applies to project: frameworks/base
     affected files: location/java/android/location/GpsStatus.java
                     services/java/com/android/server/location/GpsLocationProvider.java

This patch fixes the 32bit SV mask handling to adapt to GLONASS and SBAS SV ids
(PRNs). This is optional and does not affect performance.


2) u-blox GPS setup
-----------------------

provided patch file: 4.0.x/v40x_ubx_gps_setup.patch
 applies to project: device/ti/panda
     affected files: device.mk
                     fstab.omap4pandaboard
                     init.omap4pandaboard.rc
                     ubx-setup.sh 

Adds a ubx-setup.sh script, launched at boot, that sets up networkin on eth0
and asserts correct permissions on the UART.

This is mainly for internal development and should be adopted to the particular
setup in use.


3) development tools
-----------------------

provided patch file: 4.0.x/v40x_development.patch (and local_manifest.xml)
 applies to project: device/ti/panda
     affected files: full_panda.mk

This adds libncurses, busybox and bash packages to the build. Requires the
supplied local_manifest.xml installed in the .repo directory.

4) Network state update
-----------------------
provided patch file: 7.0.0_r33/v7.0.0_r33_network_update_frameworks_base.patch
 applies to project: frameworks/base
     affected files: services/core/java/com/android/server/location/GnssLocationProvider.java

Android 7.0.0 contains a bug which prevents the Android framework from
notifying the GNSS HAL of changes in the network state. This prevents
the aiding functionality of the driver from working properly in an
unmodified framework.

By applying the provided patch, Android 7.0.0 is modified to
behave similarly to previous versions again.
